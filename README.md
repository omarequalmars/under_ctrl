# Control Systems Repository

This repository contains a collection of header files and some .c files for testing. The header files include functions for various control systems, filters, and DC motor operation.

## PID Control
`PID.h` is a header file containing a family of functions relating to PID control, mainly culminating in a complete PID function with saturation and anti-windup features.

## Model-Reference Adaptive Control
`MRAC.h` is a header file containing functions for Model-Reference Adaptive Control implementing the Lyapunov-rule.

## Filters
`filters.h` contains functions for FIR/IIR filters.

## DC Motor Operation
`DCMotorHBridge.h` is a header file containing a family of functions commonly used in the operation of DC Motors using H-bridges.

## Future Plans
In the future, it is possible that this project is expanded to include functions for other controllers and bring advanced control systems to both enthusiasts', students', and professionals' fingertips.

## Important Note
Please read the comments inside the header files before using them in your code. It is important for your project to know how these functions work and how to correctly use them.
