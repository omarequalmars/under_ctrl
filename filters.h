        It takes an exponentially weighed moving average over the readings

        ================================
        alpha is the MA Weight:
        alpha = 1 means the filter output will essentially be the same as the input.
        As alpha is decreased, the effective moving average window is increased
        to the effect of higher order smoothing, however note that this comes with a larger lag effect
        where the output is phase-shifted

       It updates the state (readings_1) from sensor 1
       and it's derivative from sensor 2 and recursively updates the fused reading.
       It is recommended to trace the function for the best understanding.
       =======================================================
       alpha is the weight coefficient for sensor 1 (proportional to how much it is 'trusted')
       0 <= alpha <= 1
       in the extreme cases, alpha = 1 means the filter will converge to sensor 1
